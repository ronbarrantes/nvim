# LazyVim

Things needed for this thing to work

- Nvim
- Node
- Lua
- ripgrep
- a nerd font (currently using Maslo Nerd Font)
- a terminal that supports true color (Currently using iterm2 on MacOS)

### Other things to add

lsp
treesitter
undotree
cloak
fugitive
tpope
refactoring
use("github/copilot.vim")

## NOTES

- I need lua, python (probably)
- I need to download `fzf`
- I need `brew install ripgrep`
- I need to temporarily get github copilot to sign in and then I can do without it (probably)
